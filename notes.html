My html notes.<br>

Markup is written in markdown.<br> It tells the computer how to structure the text.<br>

Mary had a little toad <br>
It's skin as tough as shell <br>
And every file that toad would write <br>
it used HTML. <br>

<p>This is a paragraph, isn't it cool?</p>
<p><em>HTML</em> is a <mark>markup language used to create web pages</mark>.</p>
<p>Another paragraph</p>

First paragraph.

Second paragraph.

Yay, we like space!
